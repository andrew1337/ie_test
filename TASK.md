This is a quick coding problem. It’s important to note that it’s by no means a test, we just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems. 

Here is a CSV file that includes a catalog.

We would like you to build a simple server for:
Reading the CSV every day
Storing the updated data in a DB
Exposing a single API to get a list of products by a producer. You should include some kind of pagination mechanism in your implementation

Please notice:
you don't need to build any UI for this task
you can use any external library you want
We expect to get it done by a week from now (it shouldn't take more than a couple of hours, but feel free to use as much time as you want).

Let me know if the scope makes sense, and if you have any other questions.
